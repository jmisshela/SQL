/*This Spotify database was downloaded from Kaggle.
I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
Then, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.*/

/*Creating the table:*/
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

/*Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.*/

/*Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.*/


/*1st Analysis: I determined the top 10 songs and the singer by popularity.*/
SELECT
    artist_name,
    track_name,
    popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

/*2nd Analysis: I determined the avg popularity, danceability, and energy of the top 10 songs.*/
SELECT
    ROUND(AVG(popularity),1) AS avg_popularity,
    ROUND(AVG(danceability),1) AS avg_danceability,
    ROUND(AVG(energy),1) AS avg_energy
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10
